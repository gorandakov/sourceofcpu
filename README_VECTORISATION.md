Note simd size is 64 bit but the 2xfma is composed of 3 fpu ops each so there are 6 fpu in two domains with one free criss-cross in rs2.
It might be desirable to make the criss cross auto select the correct half when only one half contains data.
Even though vector size is 56, it is possible to do 600 with dual read domain regfile and a cross bar after scheduler, but it would have
to be done on a super conductor monistor process.
Super conductor monistor process would have the gate conductor e.g. 5-10 times thinner than the gate, so that it is possible to evacuate the charge carriers of the gate conductor without evacuating the 
charge carriers of the gate.
It is needed to support super high E field strength, might need CVD diamond gate dielectric.
It would need to use iron for the gate conductor, gate and all layers of wire except contact.

Inraloka level chips can be made without super conductor by making the silicon conductive gate partial matter, and all of the metal stack, but an extra layer of metal undeneath the silicon, which would serve as the output/input and poke through to the other side of the chip.
DDR6 12500 speed possible for external interface at current radiation limits.
600 vector cpu possible without super conductor but might use too much power.
This if done will cut off from the computer the lowest level of reality out of 3.
