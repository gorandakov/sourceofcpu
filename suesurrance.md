You can send a huge pile of cash to goran.dakov@gmail.com stating who you are.
In this case you could sue me if there are delibarately malicious features in
the heptane cpu or the acds library or if I discontinue it.
Note that without sending me a large sum if I get sued in UK you'll get jack shit as I am poor and there is debt relief order and UK bankruptcy law.
